## Briefly describe the artifact

The artifact that I have chosen is from CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms.
In this artifact, we were tasked with creating an array of numbers, and then requesting user 
input to determine where at in the array that the indexed number lies. 
This is a linear search algorithm that was created in C++.

## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio

The reason I chose this artifact is because I enjoy creating programs in both C++ and Python, and while
C++ has always been a strong language with a long history of usage, Python is a newer language with
growing popularity all over the world. Python has a large community of developers backing up and
creating new libraries everyday. Python is not only great for beginner developers, but is also
highly scalable, portable, flexible and extensible and can used for more advanced designs with applications in
Machine Learning and Internet Of Things.
