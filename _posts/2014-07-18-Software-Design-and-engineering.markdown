description1: <strong> Briefly describe the artifact.  </strong>The artifact that I have chosen is from CS-260 - Data Structures and Algorithms. In this artifact, we were tasked with creating an array of numbers, and then requesting user input to determine where at in the array that the indexed number lies. The changes that I want to make with this project is to recreate the program using Python as the language and coming up with the same results. Below you will see how the project was created using C++. As you can see, it was created and able to successfully run the project, but I did lack in commenting the code properly to what each portion of the project does or what it is supposed to do. 
description2: <strong> Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. </strong>The reason I chose this artifact is because I enjoy creating programs in both C++ and Python, and while C++ has always been a strong language with a long history of usage, Python is a newer language with growing popularity all over the world. Python has a large community of developers backing up and creating new libraries everyday. Python is not only great for beginner developers, but is also highly scalable, portable, flexible and extensible and can be used for more advanced designs with applications in Machine Learning and Internet Of Things.
description3: <strong> Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. </strong> With the program being created in C++ originally, and me being familiar with Python as it was the first language that I taught myself before going back to school for Computer Science, I had not actually ever created this type of algorithm with Python. I went and learned a little about how lienar search algorithms are created with Python, and then implemented this design according to how the C++ program was designed. While maintaining the same layout with user input and how the array was set up, recreating the program with Python was rather simple and I was able to successfully run the program with identical results.
description4: <strong> List of enhancements that I performed. </strong> <ul><li>Converted code to Python</li><li>Created a search function to iterate through an array</li><li>Made an 'int' input to read user input as an integer</li><li>Print out the results of where in the array the user input is located</li></ul>
